  ## Ensembl species name
  species: danio_rerio
  ## Emsembl release
  release: 111
  ## Genome build
  build: GRCz11

## Read length of raw FASTQ data
## Used for calculating the maximum possible overhang for reads across splice junctions
## (i.e. for STAR's --sjdbOverhang paramter)
read_length: 98

## featureCounts configuration
count:
  ## Strandedness of the library, passed to the -s option
  ## 0: unstranded, 1: stranded, and 2: reversely stranded
  strandedness: 0
  ## -J count the number of reads supporting each exon-exon junction
  ## -p indicates the BAM files contain paired-end data, omit this flag for single-end
  ## --fracOverlap minimum fraction of overlapping bases required for read assignment to a feature
  ## --minOverlap minimum number of overlapping bases required for read assignment to a feature
  extra: "-J -p --fracOverlap 1 --minOverlap 35"
